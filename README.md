# todo-list

## A todo page that allows users to make different projects that each individually store todos that can be added and edited.

This project was made after learning about modules and basic OOP principles like S.O.L.I.D. While also learning new things as project was being built. Such as local storage, how to stringify and parse JSON, creating a modal.

Functionality of project includes making todos for a selected project and using local storage to save all projects and todos. The todos can then be edited or deleted while it updates local storage and will only affect the current project selected. Users can also create new projects and switch back and forth.
